To link to a specific line in another sheet in Google Sheets, you can follow these steps:

    Go to the cell in your sheet where you want to add the link.
    Right-click on the cell and select "Insert link" or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + K.
    In the "Link" box that appears, select "Sheets in this spreadsheet" or "Drive" depending on where the sheet you want to link to is located.
    Find and select the sheet you want to link to.
    In the "Cell Link" field, enter the cell reference of the specific line you want to link to in the format of "Sheet Name!Cell Reference".
        For example, to link to cell A10 on Sheet2, you would enter "Sheet2!A10".
    Click "Apply" to create the link.

Alternatively, you can also use the HYPERLINK formula to create the link.
The formula would look like this: =HYPERLINK("link_location","friendly_name").
In the "link_location" field, you would enter the same cell reference as above ("Sheet Name!Cell Reference") and in the "friendly_name" field, 
    you can enter any text you want to use as the clickable link text.

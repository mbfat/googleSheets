google sheets delete a line if no check box

To delete a row in Google Sheets if the checkbox in that row is unchecked, you can use a script. Here are the steps to do it:

    Insert checkboxes in the cells of the column you want to use (for example, column A).
    Right-click the sheet tab and select "Script editor".
    In the script editor, copy and paste the following code:

function deleteUncheckedRows() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  for (var i = data.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (data[i][0] === false) {
      sheet.deleteRow(i + 1);
    }
  }
}

    Save the script and go back to the sheet.
    Select the column where you inserted the checkboxes (for example, column A).
    Go to "Data" > "Data validation".
    In the "Criteria" section, select "Checkbox" and in the "Show validation help text" section, add "Tick the box to keep the row, untick to delete".
    Click "Save".
    Now, each time you tick or untick a checkbox, you can run the "deleteUncheckedRows" script to remove the unchecked rows.
